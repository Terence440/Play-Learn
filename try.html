                        Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to
                        perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the
                        project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans,
                        such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.
                        Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that
                        computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs
                        for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing
                        advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can
                        match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the
                        other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and
                        professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this
                        limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines,
                        and voice or handwriting recognition.
